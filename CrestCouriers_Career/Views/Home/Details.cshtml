                                <p>As the year commenced the spread of the COVID-19 virus is one that is yet to be contained, continuing to affect millions of jobs and sectors every day. The transportation and logistics industry are ones that continue to provide one of the most vital services in our current modernised global and interconnected world, meaning with the current restrictions put into place many companies are facing national and international trade and transportation issues within this climate. In this instance, there has therefore been a variety of interpretations surrounding future impact and risk implications which we will further explore within this article.</p>


                                <p>While we are moving into a digital era, our current society is leading towards a constant and further demand for purchases online. Therefore, the need for reliable delivery couriers are more important than ever. This is why the importance around following the new introduced health and safety precautions surrounding the outbreak, whilst continuing keeping drivers and staff members safe will remain a vital priority. Due to this increased demand there is also the opportunity for a new market. As hospitals and private medical sectors are more strained that ever, it has been key to be able to deliver medical supplies where necessary and expand into logistical partners for medicine and similar industries for the future.</p>

                                <p>The UK formally exited the EU on 31st January 2020. The 11-month transition period meant for negotiating a new trade deal will come to an end on 31st December. But there is still no sign of a new deal. In the absence of a free trade deal, which would allow goods to be transported without any tariffs, UK will default to WTO tariffs.</p>


                                <p>
                                    Along with a good chance that taxes will be applicable to imports and exports between the UK and EU, it is also a given that customs regulations will be enacted at the border. Customs regulations will most likely result in delays at the border, causing disruption in supply chains and directly affecting fast-moving consumer goods (like vegetables, fruits, cadies, toiletries, etc.) Moreover, new IT systems need to be installed and customs staff recruited to run operations at the border.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    More than half of the UK’s import and export takes place with the EU. This means that the government and the businesses inside UK who deal with parties in the EU are presented with the great challenge of ensuring efficiency in the transport of goods between the UK and the EU. Both are largely underprepared in this regard.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    While businesses have their own challenges to deal with in terms of complying with customs requirements and smooth sailing of relevant paperwork, they have also expressed serious concern to the government over the lack of clarity in how things will be run in the logistics industry. The government, on the other hand, has invested millions to try to ensure smooth sailing of the new systems. Detailed instruction manuals are being published on the government’s official website to assist businesses to comply with new regulations.
                                </p>

                                <p class="thme-blockquote">

                                    But the fact remains that it is not possible to efficiently transition from a 40-year-old system of trade to a new one in just one year. There are gaps and holes in how preparations are being made for post-transition period trade. Industry specialists are expecting many disruptions and delays in border checks and supply lines, all of which will affect the timely delivery of goods to consumers. Moreover, customers will most likely have to put up with increased product prices, thanks to tariffs. From what it looks like, a brief period of chaos will ensue following the end of the transition period on 31st December.

                                <p>Lorry drivers are responsible for providing essential supplies to citizens across the country. In fact, they were identified as key workers by the government during the pandemic. Travelling on roads for days, they need to park their vehicles at some safe and convenient spot at night, so they can get some rest and sleep. However, there is currently a shortage of such safe parking areas for lorry drivers. According to the Road Haulage Association, there is a need for about 11,000 safe, overnight parking places for HGVs.</p>


                                <p>
                                    While the quality and availability of parking areas for lorries has been a concern for drivers for some time, the growing incidents of lorries being targeted by thieves has led to increased alarm over the safety of the drivers and the goods they are transporting. The National Vehicle Crime Intelligence Service reported that goods amounting to nearly £50 million had been stolen in over 3,000 lorry thefts in the UK from January to September.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Most robberies occur at unsafe parking locations at night time when drivers stop to sleep. Resistance is difficult, considering the thieves could be armed and could potentially harm the drivers. In such a scenario, drivers are usually relying only on luck to protect them from being the next one to fall prey to a robbery. The robberies sometimes result in damage to lorries, necessitating that they are taken off the roads for repair. They can also cause a delay in delivery of goods to consumers and may result in goods being damaged, which then results in further problems for the customer.
                                </p>

                                    Back in November, a lorry was hijacked on a road in Northamptonshire, with the driver and a security guard tied up as the thieves made off with £5 million worth of Apple products. The pair and the lorry were later abandoned on the road, while the thieves changed two vehicles and made off with the stolen items successfully. The stolen products included Apple iPhones, Watches, and chargers. The police in Northamptonshire had asked people to come up if they had seen vehicles that may have looked out of place or if they had been offered Apple products at unusually low prices.

                                    With multiple thieves responsible for around 30,000 lorry thefts in the UK at large, lorry drivers continue to feel unsafe, businesses face potential losses, and customers have to put up with delayed deliveries of goods.

                                    When the UK's planned exit from the European Union becomes official in 2021, many things will change for businesses who import and export goods to and from the UK. With the involvement of the bureaucracy, tedious paperwork, border checks, and increased taxes, many businesses within the EU will simply stop dealing with the UK to avoid complications. With the decrease in businesses willing to deal with the UK, the UK market will become less competitive, and prices of every product and service will increase.
                                </p>

                                    Currently, it costs about £20 to ship a 10kg parcel to Sweden (an EU member) from the UK, while the cost of delivering the same package to a non-EU member like Norway is about £36. The difference of about 80% has to do with less market competitiveness. Basically, delivery companies aren't lining up to deliver to Norway because of the increased hassle of customs and border controls. And the same will happen with the UK post-Brexit when it becomes a less attractive and hence less competitive market for sellers in the EU.
                                </p>

                                    What this means for shoppers across the UK is that it will be far more expensive to buy goods when Christmas comes next year, and there will be fewer products to choose from. Hence, this Christmas is an ideal opportunity for Brits to buy what they want at pocket-friendly rates. And if the UK fails to enter a free-trade deal with the EU, which seems quite likely, the increase in costs of imported goods will be huge by next Christmas.

                                    The coronavirus pandemic perhaps fuelled the 50% increase seen in online sales this year. Along with increased sales, there was an unprecedented demand for goods to be delivered at home. Brexit caused a 30% shortfall in warehouse workers and drivers, and with supply chains already strained, any more load during Christmas can stretch companies beyond capacity.

                                    Businesses usually see a boom around Christmas time, allowing them to make profits that cover their yearly costs. Many retailers see their sales doubling up. With families estranged from each other and people spending Christmas at homes due to the pandemic, high volumes of requests will come in for deliveries of goods to loved ones around Christmas time. Both retailers and couriers need to work efficiently to meet this increased demand for their services in a timely manner. Online shoppers should take the precaution of buying and sending their Christmas gifts before time to avoid any delays in delivery.

                                    The supply chain in the UK has come under great strain due to the global effects of the pandemic, the increased demands of goods over Christmas, and the uncertainty caused by Brexit. Delays in shipments and excessive amounts of time taken in unloading vessels are leading to increased freight costs, which ultimately translates to higher product prices for end-consumers.

                                <p>
                                    The coronavirus pandemic had disrupted freight transport globally as production schedules and demand shifted overnight. But the recent problems in the logistics industry have more to do with overcrowded ports than with supply chain disruptions caused by global shipping. The largest port in the UK, Felixstowe in Suffolk, has come under the microscope for causing a blockage in the supply of goods. According to Felixstowe, a partial reason for the delay were the shipments of the personal protective equipment that had been ordered by the government.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    In response to the logistics industry’s complaints, the government has blamed the delays in goods delivery on the global disruption in the supply chain. However, businesses maintain that they had pointed out the problem at the ports long ago. Since the UK ports aren’t able to accommodate the increased shipments coming in due to increased orders at Christmas time, the time for unloading ships has increased significantly, creating huge backlogs at ports. Due to extreme delays, congestion charges are being added by carriers. The result is that product prices are increasing from 3 to 4 times, making goods extremely overpriced. To avoid going into a loss, businesses have to either stop importing products or ask the customers to pay the extra charges.

                                    To solve the problem, people from the logistics, ports, and shipping industries have requested the government to increase the capacity for loading and unloading containers at the port. Some ways to do it include allowing hauliers more hours to collect containers, having more trains run to and from ports and for longer durations, and letting drivers do longer shifts when possible.
                                </p>

                                    The goods are not just stuck at UK ports; instead, businesses are reporting that it is becoming increasingly difficult to get their goods out of China and Asia because fewer numbers of ships are setting out for the UK from these countries. To avoid the disruption at UK ports, many ships sailing from Asia are choosing ports in northern-European locations over the UK, further delaying the delivery of imports to the UK. These delays are resulting in unusual price hikes for customers in the UK.

                                    A major responsibility that couriers have is delivering important, confidential documents on time. As more and more accounting and law firms are attempting to reset their professional standards after the repercussions of COVID-19, the demand for courier services is increasing.
                                </p>

                                <h3>Why do law and accounting firms need couriers?</h3>

                                <p>
                                    Successful accounting and law firms have a lot of clients and a lot of paperwork to sort through. The clients rely on accountants and lawyers to fill up their forms and expect them to deliver them. And for agencies that are primarily concerned with legal and financial matters, it's not possible to run a delivery business on the side.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    That is where courier service providers come in. When people start scrambling to fill up relevant forms during the tax season, they often take the help of accounting firms. Apart from filling up W-2s, I-9s, and other forms, a major concern is to deliver the documents promptly. Couriers help accountants send necessary tax forms, payrolls, and audits in record time.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Lawyers work on tight deadlines throughout the year. Sensitive civil and criminal cases require many documents to be delivered between law firms and courts. Sometimes, larger legal firms may need courier services to exchange documents between their offices. From reports, notices, and evidence, many important deliveries need to be made on time. Clients and lawyers alike need a trustworthy service to make these deliveries for them.
                                </p>

                                <p class="thme-blockquote">

                                </p>

                                <h3>What do lawyers and accountants look for in courier service providers?</h3>

                                <p>
                                    There are certain reasons why accountants and solicitors prefer to send their documents through specialized courier service providers instead of public service providers. To begin with, law and accountancy firms usually have documents that contain sensitive information. Couriers guarantee complete confidentiality and ensure that the papers remained safe during delivery. Secondly, as lawyers often have tight deadlines to contend with, they need those service providers that can deliver their documents and parcels within the same day. Thus, speed is a significant reason why some courier services are chosen above others.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    The goods are not just stuck at UK ports; instead, businesses are reporting that it is becoming increasingly difficult to get their goods out of China and Asia because fewer numbers of ships are setting out for the UK from these countries. To avoid the disruption at UK ports, many ships sailing from Asia are choosing ports in northern-European locations over the UK, further delaying the delivery of imports to the UK. These delays are resulting in unusual price hikes for customers in the UK.

                                    Courier service providers assist business owners across all industries in the UK. The construction sector is also one such industry that relies heavily on couriers for its business operations. Construction sites require a steady supply of raw materials, individual parts, and equipment for assisting in construction.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Generally, there isn’t a lot of space for storing construction materials on the site, meaning that deliveries have to be made every day for work to be done efficiently. Luckily, couriers in the UK are up to the task, maintaining industry standards by making timely deliveries. In fact, at the start of the year 2020, the UK’s construction business was booming.
                                </p>

                                    However, that changed when the coronavirus hit the world in March. Much like other industries, the building sector also saw business plummeting. The initial lockdown and on-site work restrictions caused a lot of disruption in the industry. Workers went home, supply chains were disrupted, and work stopped at the previously active sites.

                                    By April, the UK construction industry’s outputs fell to three times lower than the outputs in the financial crisis of 2009. This was the lowest point for the industry, and a significant reason for this was the unavailability of required materials and instruments for building.
                                </p>

                                    Soon, the government lifted the lockdown from the construction sector, along with other crucial businesses. New rules and regulations regarding work on site were imposed, and things started to pick up. With industry-relevant services resuming all over the country, couriers ensured that supply chains were resumed and workflow continued.

                                    As a result, over the summer, there has been a boom in house sales and construction work. While many other industries have been facing economic repercussions, the property and construction sectors have seen a massive upsurge in demand. This current demand goes against all expert predictions that stated that real estate and construction sectors would see little to no business due to the pandemic.

                                    The reason for increased new orders is the backlog of work from summer. Back then, the construction business had seen a temporary slump. As of now, housebuilding is the biggest in-demand service, while other home-improvements services are also in demand.

                                    Some specialists in the field still believe that delivery models need to be redefined to increase productivity and efficiency; however, the housing industry is in full bloom.

                                    Everyone loves online shopping. After all, what is not to love about having ample time to go through products and their prices, choosing one you like, and then having it delivered at your doorstep – all with the guarantee of it being refundable. Convenient (and in some cases addictive) as online shopping is, it has an ugly side to it. Individual parcels being delivered to homes by couriers all over the country is not as good for the environment as one might have hoped.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    One of the significant causes of carbon emissions is transport, and a lot of that comes from vehicles on their way to delivering parcels. With the rise in online shopping over the past few years, this issue is more relevant today than ever. Many businesses incentivize customers to buy online through free deliveries, and in some cases, through deliveries on the same day. This means that smaller and smaller parcels are dispatched, many of which are returned, as customers are allowed to refund and exchange delivered items.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    What this means for the environment, however, is that the number of carbon emissions in the atmosphere is continuously going up. In order to tackle this issue, some courier services are introducing newer, greener initiatives, which include running hybrid or electric vehicles and delivering by bikes and foot. Many couriers plan to roll out tens of thousands of electric trucks.
                                </p>

                                    While these measures will be effective when they have been implemented completely in the future, what should consumers do till then? Though some people think deleting shopping apps and never ordering online is the way to go, other, less drastic but still effective measures are also possible.
                                </p>

                                    One way to help the environment is to shop from those retailers and service providers who have definitive, innovative green policies in place. When enough customers do this, companies will be forced to make green policies a priority. Another way of reducing one’s carbon footprint is to ask couriers to deliver at a collection point nearby. Later, you may pick the item by walking over or when passing by it in your daily commute. Its purpose will be wasted, however, if you go over especially by car to pick up your delivery.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    While the onus of making the transport business environment-friendly rests on service providers, customers can pay their part by making conscious choices like buying from local stores, having items delivered to a common collection point, and not shopping mindlessly in the first place.

                                    Around the world, there has been a growing concern among customers about the carbon footprint of the services they consume. And courier businesses, unfortunately, emit a lot of carbon emissions. However, that is soon about to change because more and more couriers are opting for electric vehicles.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    While electric vans are the newest thing in courier business today, they seemed like an improbability only a short while ago. That was because an enormous upfront cost was associated with these vehicles, which made them an unprofitable choice for most businesses. However, in recent years, the costs of electric batteries have drastically decreased. Electric vehicles are also being made of new composite material and going through remodelling, allowing their weight to be decreased. As a result, they have become cheaper and can go around the city the whole day after being charged at night.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Today, electric vehicles have become a smart investment option for courier businesses. This is because, in the long-run, electric vans will use lesser energy compared to those run on fuel. Not only that, but they will also have lower maintenance costs because of fewer components. All in all, the operational costs may be lowered up to 20%.
                                </p>

                                <p class="thme-blockquote">

                                <p>
                                    There is still one more reason that electric vehicles rather are preferable to the traditional fuel-run ones. As stated earlier, customers care about sustainability and the environment. Innovative solutions to the dangers posed to the environment by human activities are something that brands can use to build value. It helps them attract modern consumers and retain employees because everyone feels they are contributing to a green earth.

                                <p>
                                    Perhaps that is why all the big names in the courier business have announced some sort of plan of rolling out electric vehicles. UPS had started using electric vehicles as early as 2018. It has entered into a deal with Arrival to purchase 10,000 electric trucks. Amazon has developed its first custom electric vehicle in collaboration with Rivian and plans to roll out 10,000 vehicles by 2022. FedEx in the US was probably earlier than all in getting hybrid and electric vehicles on the road.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    By the looks of it, electric vans are the future of courier businesses. With costs continuing to decrease and new models being developed, sooner or later, all couriers will shift to using electric vehicles.

                                    One of the biggest challenges faced by courier services is to keep their fuel costs in check. Excessive use of fuel is not only dangerous for the environment, but it also adds to business expenditures and either lowers profits or drives away customers with increased service charges. Hence, it is necessary for courier services to keep their fuel usage to the minimum.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    While fuel efficiency may be achieved through buying newer, more fuel-efficient vehicles or optimizing routes and strategically planning transportation, the most effective way of cutting down fuel costs is training drivers to drive responsibly. Below are a few ways that courier drivers can reduce fuel consumption:
                                </p>

                                <ol>
                                    <li>
                                        <h5>Avoiding Idling Waste</h5>
                                        <p>
                                            When vehicle engines are left running unnecessarily for long periods, it contributes significantly to fuel costs. If drivers make it a habit to turn off the engine when the vehicle is not running, it will save costs.
                                        </p>

                                        <h5>Maintaining A Stable Speed</h5>
                                        <p>
                                            Most heavy-duty vehicles consume fuel optimally when their speed is between 35 and 50 MPH. When drivers increase or decrease the speed abruptly, it causes fuel to burn up faster. Therefore, it is recommended to stay within the vehicle’s optimal fuel efficiency speed.
                                        </p>
                                    </li>

                                        <h5>Using Cruise Control</h5>
                                        <p>
                                            Drivers can use the cruise control to set up a steady, consistent speed for their vehicles, which would ensure that fuel is used efficiently. However, cruise control should not be used when the traffic is heavy or when travelling uphill.
                                        </p>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <h5>Coasting</h5>
                                        <p>
                                            Instead of using hard breaks to come to a stop at a traffic light or otherwise, drivers can learn to determine the appropriate time for stopping ahead of time and use acceleration minimization techniques and coasting to come to a stop. This not only helps save on fuel but also extends the vehicle’s lifespan.
                                        </p>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <h5>Caring for the Vehicle</h5>
                                        <p>
                                            Lastly, drivers need to look after the vehicle they drive on the road day in and day out. This includes keeping the tires inflated at the correct pressure to boost their life and improve fuel efficiency, as well as keeping the gas tank filled appropriately (avoid overfilling, as that can lead to overflowing).
                                        </p>
                                    </li>
                                </ol>

                                <p>
                                    When drivers are accustomed to certain driving habits (which are hazardous for the vehicle or use too much fuel), it can take a while to master new techniques and ways of driving until they eventually become new habits. However, courier drivers should invest time and effort in learning the right driving techniques to help save fuel, which will reduce costs and benefit the environment.

                                    The National Health Service relies heavily on courier services to carry out its daily tasks. From collecting and delivering samples and patient records to medicines and reports, logistics are essential in its day-to-day operations.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Not only is the delivery of such items essential, but it is also a high priority – meaning that, often, lives can depend on the timely arrival of packages. Many times, important operations and treatments cannot be started until test reports arrive from laboratories. At any time, hospitals can run out of essential supplies and could need to order more. In such instances, having a reliable courier service can save time, prevent mismanagement, and help reduce people's pain and misery.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    This is why the NHS employs multiple courier services to help in its operations. 
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    While delivery vehicles for the NHS carry out vital tasks, they are often powered by diesel and are hazardous for the environment. Diesel-based vans emit carbon emissions, contributing to air pollution. They also cause congestion on the roads.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    But for so long, their use on the roads has gone unquestioned because they are seen as a necessary evil.  A little damage to the environment almost becomes justifiable when it is for as noble a cause as saving lives. However, recently, NHS has come up with a solution to prevent some of this damage.
                                </p>

                                <p class="thme-blockquote">
                                    The Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust looked for alternative ways to deliver packages that would be more environmentally friendly. The solution came in the form of electric bikes that would be used to deliver medical specimens, reports, and records across two hospital sites in Newcastle.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    The trial period of running electric bike cargo services in place of traditional diesel-run vehicles was smooth. The deliveries were made on time, and the delivery load volume was handled adequately.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    The electric bike delivery service ran on a trial period of three months. It replaced about 500 miles of transport that was previously conducted by diesel-based vehicles.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    The benefits of the electric bike cargo service were threefold. Firstly, it was estimated that carbon emissions were reduced in the environment by up to 436g in just three months. Secondly, almost £6,250 were saved in the trial period. And thirdly, it contributed to a better experience for both patients and staff as the delivery bikes took up less parking space.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    The trial period for electric bikes ran successfully, reducing carbon emissions and improving local air quality. However, there is a need to implement the electric delivery services in their full force throughout the NHS.
                                </p>
