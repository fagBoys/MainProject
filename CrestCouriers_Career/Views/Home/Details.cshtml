                                <p>As the year commenced the spread of the COVID-19 virus is one that is yet to be contained, continuing to affect millions of jobs and sectors every day. The transportation and logistics industry are ones that continue to provide one of the most vital services in our current modernised global and interconnected world, meaning with the current restrictions put into place many companies are facing national and international trade and transportation issues within this climate. In this instance, there has therefore been a variety of interpretations surrounding future impact and risk implications which we will further explore within this article.</p>


                                <p>While we are moving into a digital era, our current society is leading towards a constant and further demand for purchases online. Therefore, the need for reliable delivery couriers are more important than ever. This is why the importance around following the new introduced health and safety precautions surrounding the outbreak, whilst continuing keeping drivers and staff members safe will remain a vital priority. Due to this increased demand there is also the opportunity for a new market. As hospitals and private medical sectors are more strained that ever, it has been key to be able to deliver medical supplies where necessary and expand into logistical partners for medicine and similar industries for the future.</p>

                                <p>The UK formally exited the EU on 31st January 2020. The 11-month transition period meant for negotiating a new trade deal will come to an end on 31st December. But there is still no sign of a new deal. In the absence of a free trade deal, which would allow goods to be transported without any tariffs, UK will default to WTO tariffs.</p>


                                <p>
                                    Along with a good chance that taxes will be applicable to imports and exports between the UK and EU, it is also a given that customs regulations will be enacted at the border. Customs regulations will most likely result in delays at the border, causing disruption in supply chains and directly affecting fast-moving consumer goods (like vegetables, fruits, cadies, toiletries, etc.) Moreover, new IT systems need to be installed and customs staff recruited to run operations at the border.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    More than half of the UK’s import and export takes place with the EU. This means that the government and the businesses inside UK who deal with parties in the EU are presented with the great challenge of ensuring efficiency in the transport of goods between the UK and the EU. Both are largely underprepared in this regard.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    While businesses have their own challenges to deal with in terms of complying with customs requirements and smooth sailing of relevant paperwork, they have also expressed serious concern to the government over the lack of clarity in how things will be run in the logistics industry. The government, on the other hand, has invested millions to try to ensure smooth sailing of the new systems. Detailed instruction manuals are being published on the government’s official website to assist businesses to comply with new regulations.
                                </p>

                                <p class="thme-blockquote">

                                    But the fact remains that it is not possible to efficiently transition from a 40-year-old system of trade to a new one in just one year. There are gaps and holes in how preparations are being made for post-transition period trade. Industry specialists are expecting many disruptions and delays in border checks and supply lines, all of which will affect the timely delivery of goods to consumers. Moreover, customers will most likely have to put up with increased product prices, thanks to tariffs. From what it looks like, a brief period of chaos will ensue following the end of the transition period on 31st December.

                                <p>Lorry drivers are responsible for providing essential supplies to citizens across the country. In fact, they were identified as key workers by the government during the pandemic. Travelling on roads for days, they need to park their vehicles at some safe and convenient spot at night, so they can get some rest and sleep. However, there is currently a shortage of such safe parking areas for lorry drivers. According to the Road Haulage Association, there is a need for about 11,000 safe, overnight parking places for HGVs.</p>


                                <p>
                                    While the quality and availability of parking areas for lorries has been a concern for drivers for some time, the growing incidents of lorries being targeted by thieves has led to increased alarm over the safety of the drivers and the goods they are transporting. The National Vehicle Crime Intelligence Service reported that goods amounting to nearly £50 million had been stolen in over 3,000 lorry thefts in the UK from January to September.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Most robberies occur at unsafe parking locations at night time when drivers stop to sleep. Resistance is difficult, considering the thieves could be armed and could potentially harm the drivers. In such a scenario, drivers are usually relying only on luck to protect them from being the next one to fall prey to a robbery. The robberies sometimes result in damage to lorries, necessitating that they are taken off the roads for repair. They can also cause a delay in delivery of goods to consumers and may result in goods being damaged, which then results in further problems for the customer.
                                </p>

                                    Back in November, a lorry was hijacked on a road in Northamptonshire, with the driver and a security guard tied up as the thieves made off with £5 million worth of Apple products. The pair and the lorry were later abandoned on the road, while the thieves changed two vehicles and made off with the stolen items successfully. The stolen products included Apple iPhones, Watches, and chargers. The police in Northamptonshire had asked people to come up if they had seen vehicles that may have looked out of place or if they had been offered Apple products at unusually low prices.

                                    With multiple thieves responsible for around 30,000 lorry thefts in the UK at large, lorry drivers continue to feel unsafe, businesses face potential losses, and customers have to put up with delayed deliveries of goods.

                                    When the UK's planned exit from the European Union becomes official in 2021, many things will change for businesses who import and export goods to and from the UK. With the involvement of the bureaucracy, tedious paperwork, border checks, and increased taxes, many businesses within the EU will simply stop dealing with the UK to avoid complications. With the decrease in businesses willing to deal with the UK, the UK market will become less competitive, and prices of every product and service will increase.
                                </p>

                                    Currently, it costs about £20 to ship a 10kg parcel to Sweden (an EU member) from the UK, while the cost of delivering the same package to a non-EU member like Norway is about £36. The difference of about 80% has to do with less market competitiveness. Basically, delivery companies aren't lining up to deliver to Norway because of the increased hassle of customs and border controls. And the same will happen with the UK post-Brexit when it becomes a less attractive and hence less competitive market for sellers in the EU.
                                </p>

                                    What this means for shoppers across the UK is that it will be far more expensive to buy goods when Christmas comes next year, and there will be fewer products to choose from. Hence, this Christmas is an ideal opportunity for Brits to buy what they want at pocket-friendly rates. And if the UK fails to enter a free-trade deal with the EU, which seems quite likely, the increase in costs of imported goods will be huge by next Christmas.

                                    The coronavirus pandemic perhaps fuelled the 50% increase seen in online sales this year. Along with increased sales, there was an unprecedented demand for goods to be delivered at home. Brexit caused a 30% shortfall in warehouse workers and drivers, and with supply chains already strained, any more load during Christmas can stretch companies beyond capacity.

                                    Businesses usually see a boom around Christmas time, allowing them to make profits that cover their yearly costs. Many retailers see their sales doubling up. With families estranged from each other and people spending Christmas at homes due to the pandemic, high volumes of requests will come in for deliveries of goods to loved ones around Christmas time. Both retailers and couriers need to work efficiently to meet this increased demand for their services in a timely manner. Online shoppers should take the precaution of buying and sending their Christmas gifts before time to avoid any delays in delivery.

                                    The supply chain in the UK has come under great strain due to the global effects of the pandemic, the increased demands of goods over Christmas, and the uncertainty caused by Brexit. Delays in shipments and excessive amounts of time taken in unloading vessels are leading to increased freight costs, which ultimately translates to higher product prices for end-consumers.

                                <p>
                                    The coronavirus pandemic had disrupted freight transport globally as production schedules and demand shifted overnight. But the recent problems in the logistics industry have more to do with overcrowded ports than with supply chain disruptions caused by global shipping. The largest port in the UK, Felixstowe in Suffolk, has come under the microscope for causing a blockage in the supply of goods. According to Felixstowe, a partial reason for the delay were the shipments of the personal protective equipment that had been ordered by the government.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    In response to the logistics industry’s complaints, the government has blamed the delays in goods delivery on the global disruption in the supply chain. However, businesses maintain that they had pointed out the problem at the ports long ago. Since the UK ports aren’t able to accommodate the increased shipments coming in due to increased orders at Christmas time, the time for unloading ships has increased significantly, creating huge backlogs at ports. Due to extreme delays, congestion charges are being added by carriers. The result is that product prices are increasing from 3 to 4 times, making goods extremely overpriced. To avoid going into a loss, businesses have to either stop importing products or ask the customers to pay the extra charges.

                                    To solve the problem, people from the logistics, ports, and shipping industries have requested the government to increase the capacity for loading and unloading containers at the port. Some ways to do it include allowing hauliers more hours to collect containers, having more trains run to and from ports and for longer durations, and letting drivers do longer shifts when possible.
                                </p>

                                    The goods are not just stuck at UK ports; instead, businesses are reporting that it is becoming increasingly difficult to get their goods out of China and Asia because fewer numbers of ships are setting out for the UK from these countries. To avoid the disruption at UK ports, many ships sailing from Asia are choosing ports in northern-European locations over the UK, further delaying the delivery of imports to the UK. These delays are resulting in unusual price hikes for customers in the UK.

                                    A major responsibility that couriers have is delivering important, confidential documents on time. As more and more accounting and law firms are attempting to reset their professional standards after the repercussions of COVID-19, the demand for courier services is increasing.
                                </p>

                                <h3>Why do law and accounting firms need couriers?</h3>

                                <p>
                                    Successful accounting and law firms have a lot of clients and a lot of paperwork to sort through. The clients rely on accountants and lawyers to fill up their forms and expect them to deliver them. And for agencies that are primarily concerned with legal and financial matters, it's not possible to run a delivery business on the side.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    That is where courier service providers come in. When people start scrambling to fill up relevant forms during the tax season, they often take the help of accounting firms. Apart from filling up W-2s, I-9s, and other forms, a major concern is to deliver the documents promptly. Couriers help accountants send necessary tax forms, payrolls, and audits in record time.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Lawyers work on tight deadlines throughout the year. Sensitive civil and criminal cases require many documents to be delivered between law firms and courts. Sometimes, larger legal firms may need courier services to exchange documents between their offices. From reports, notices, and evidence, many important deliveries need to be made on time. Clients and lawyers alike need a trustworthy service to make these deliveries for them.
                                </p>

                                <p class="thme-blockquote">

                                </p>

                                <h3>What do lawyers and accountants look for in courier service providers?</h3>

                                <p>
                                    There are certain reasons why accountants and solicitors prefer to send their documents through specialized courier service providers instead of public service providers. To begin with, law and accountancy firms usually have documents that contain sensitive information. Couriers guarantee complete confidentiality and ensure that the papers remained safe during delivery. Secondly, as lawyers often have tight deadlines to contend with, they need those service providers that can deliver their documents and parcels within the same day. Thus, speed is a significant reason why some courier services are chosen above others.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    The goods are not just stuck at UK ports; instead, businesses are reporting that it is becoming increasingly difficult to get their goods out of China and Asia because fewer numbers of ships are setting out for the UK from these countries. To avoid the disruption at UK ports, many ships sailing from Asia are choosing ports in northern-European locations over the UK, further delaying the delivery of imports to the UK. These delays are resulting in unusual price hikes for customers in the UK.

                                    Courier service providers assist business owners across all industries in the UK. The construction sector is also one such industry that relies heavily on couriers for its business operations. Construction sites require a steady supply of raw materials, individual parts, and equipment for assisting in construction.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Generally, there isn’t a lot of space for storing construction materials on the site, meaning that deliveries have to be made every day for work to be done efficiently. Luckily, couriers in the UK are up to the task, maintaining industry standards by making timely deliveries. In fact, at the start of the year 2020, the UK’s construction business was booming.
                                </p>

                                    However, that changed when the coronavirus hit the world in March. Much like other industries, the building sector also saw business plummeting. The initial lockdown and on-site work restrictions caused a lot of disruption in the industry. Workers went home, supply chains were disrupted, and work stopped at the previously active sites.

                                    By April, the UK construction industry’s outputs fell to three times lower than the outputs in the financial crisis of 2009. This was the lowest point for the industry, and a significant reason for this was the unavailability of required materials and instruments for building.
                                </p>

                                    Soon, the government lifted the lockdown from the construction sector, along with other crucial businesses. New rules and regulations regarding work on site were imposed, and things started to pick up. With industry-relevant services resuming all over the country, couriers ensured that supply chains were resumed and workflow continued.

                                    As a result, over the summer, there has been a boom in house sales and construction work. While many other industries have been facing economic repercussions, the property and construction sectors have seen a massive upsurge in demand. This current demand goes against all expert predictions that stated that real estate and construction sectors would see little to no business due to the pandemic.

                                    The reason for increased new orders is the backlog of work from summer. Back then, the construction business had seen a temporary slump. As of now, housebuilding is the biggest in-demand service, while other home-improvements services are also in demand.

                                    Some specialists in the field still believe that delivery models need to be redefined to increase productivity and efficiency; however, the housing industry is in full bloom.

                                    Everyone loves online shopping. After all, what is not to love about having ample time to go through products and their prices, choosing one you like, and then having it delivered at your doorstep – all with the guarantee of it being refundable. Convenient (and in some cases addictive) as online shopping is, it has an ugly side to it. Individual parcels being delivered to homes by couriers all over the country is not as good for the environment as one might have hoped.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    One of the significant causes of carbon emissions is transport, and a lot of that comes from vehicles on their way to delivering parcels. With the rise in online shopping over the past few years, this issue is more relevant today than ever. Many businesses incentivize customers to buy online through free deliveries, and in some cases, through deliveries on the same day. This means that smaller and smaller parcels are dispatched, many of which are returned, as customers are allowed to refund and exchange delivered items.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    What this means for the environment, however, is that the number of carbon emissions in the atmosphere is continuously going up. In order to tackle this issue, some courier services are introducing newer, greener initiatives, which include running hybrid or electric vehicles and delivering by bikes and foot. Many couriers plan to roll out tens of thousands of electric trucks.
                                </p>

                                    While these measures will be effective when they have been implemented completely in the future, what should consumers do till then? Though some people think deleting shopping apps and never ordering online is the way to go, other, less drastic but still effective measures are also possible.
                                </p>

                                    One way to help the environment is to shop from those retailers and service providers who have definitive, innovative green policies in place. When enough customers do this, companies will be forced to make green policies a priority. Another way of reducing one’s carbon footprint is to ask couriers to deliver at a collection point nearby. Later, you may pick the item by walking over or when passing by it in your daily commute. Its purpose will be wasted, however, if you go over especially by car to pick up your delivery.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    While the onus of making the transport business environment-friendly rests on service providers, customers can pay their part by making conscious choices like buying from local stores, having items delivered to a common collection point, and not shopping mindlessly in the first place.

                                    Around the world, there has been a growing concern among customers about the carbon footprint of the services they consume. And courier businesses, unfortunately, emit a lot of carbon emissions. However, that is soon about to change because more and more couriers are opting for electric vehicles.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    While electric vans are the newest thing in courier business today, they seemed like an improbability only a short while ago. That was because an enormous upfront cost was associated with these vehicles, which made them an unprofitable choice for most businesses. However, in recent years, the costs of electric batteries have drastically decreased. Electric vehicles are also being made of new composite material and going through remodelling, allowing their weight to be decreased. As a result, they have become cheaper and can go around the city the whole day after being charged at night.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Today, electric vehicles have become a smart investment option for courier businesses. This is because, in the long-run, electric vans will use lesser energy compared to those run on fuel. Not only that, but they will also have lower maintenance costs because of fewer components. All in all, the operational costs may be lowered up to 20%.
                                </p>

                                <p class="thme-blockquote">

                                <p>
                                    There is still one more reason that electric vehicles rather are preferable to the traditional fuel-run ones. As stated earlier, customers care about sustainability and the environment. Innovative solutions to the dangers posed to the environment by human activities are something that brands can use to build value. It helps them attract modern consumers and retain employees because everyone feels they are contributing to a green earth.

                                <p>
                                    Perhaps that is why all the big names in the courier business have announced some sort of plan of rolling out electric vehicles. UPS had started using electric vehicles as early as 2018. It has entered into a deal with Arrival to purchase 10,000 electric trucks. Amazon has developed its first custom electric vehicle in collaboration with Rivian and plans to roll out 10,000 vehicles by 2022. FedEx in the US was probably earlier than all in getting hybrid and electric vehicles on the road.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    By the looks of it, electric vans are the future of courier businesses. With costs continuing to decrease and new models being developed, sooner or later, all couriers will shift to using electric vehicles.

                                    One of the biggest challenges faced by courier services is to keep their fuel costs in check. Excessive use of fuel is not only dangerous for the environment, but it also adds to business expenditures and either lowers profits or drives away customers with increased service charges. Hence, it is necessary for courier services to keep their fuel usage to the minimum.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    While fuel efficiency may be achieved through buying newer, more fuel-efficient vehicles or optimizing routes and strategically planning transportation, the most effective way of cutting down fuel costs is training drivers to drive responsibly. Below are a few ways that courier drivers can reduce fuel consumption:
                                </p>

                                <ol>
                                    <li>
                                        <h5>Avoiding Idling Waste</h5>
                                        <p>
                                            When vehicle engines are left running unnecessarily for long periods, it contributes significantly to fuel costs. If drivers make it a habit to turn off the engine when the vehicle is not running, it will save costs.
                                        </p>

                                        <h5>Maintaining A Stable Speed</h5>
                                        <p>
                                            Most heavy-duty vehicles consume fuel optimally when their speed is between 35 and 50 MPH. When drivers increase or decrease the speed abruptly, it causes fuel to burn up faster. Therefore, it is recommended to stay within the vehicle’s optimal fuel efficiency speed.
                                        </p>
                                    </li>

                                        <h5>Using Cruise Control</h5>
                                        <p>
                                            Drivers can use the cruise control to set up a steady, consistent speed for their vehicles, which would ensure that fuel is used efficiently. However, cruise control should not be used when the traffic is heavy or when travelling uphill.
                                        </p>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <h5>Coasting</h5>
                                        <p>
                                            Instead of using hard breaks to come to a stop at a traffic light or otherwise, drivers can learn to determine the appropriate time for stopping ahead of time and use acceleration minimization techniques and coasting to come to a stop. This not only helps save on fuel but also extends the vehicle’s lifespan.
                                        </p>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <h5>Caring for the Vehicle</h5>
                                        <p>
                                            Lastly, drivers need to look after the vehicle they drive on the road day in and day out. This includes keeping the tires inflated at the correct pressure to boost their life and improve fuel efficiency, as well as keeping the gas tank filled appropriately (avoid overfilling, as that can lead to overflowing).
                                        </p>
                                    </li>
                                </ol>

                                <p>
                                    When drivers are accustomed to certain driving habits (which are hazardous for the vehicle or use too much fuel), it can take a while to master new techniques and ways of driving until they eventually become new habits. However, courier drivers should invest time and effort in learning the right driving techniques to help save fuel, which will reduce costs and benefit the environment.

                                    The National Health Service relies heavily on courier services to carry out its daily tasks. From collecting and delivering samples and patient records to medicines and reports, logistics are essential in its day-to-day operations.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Not only is the delivery of such items essential, but it is also a high priority – meaning that, often, lives can depend on the timely arrival of packages. Many times, important operations and treatments cannot be started until test reports arrive from laboratories. At any time, hospitals can run out of essential supplies and could need to order more. In such instances, having a reliable courier service can save time, prevent mismanagement, and help reduce people's pain and misery.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    This is why the NHS employs multiple courier services to help in its operations.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    While delivery vehicles for the NHS carry out vital tasks, they are often powered by diesel and are hazardous for the environment. Diesel-based vans emit carbon emissions, contributing to air pollution. They also cause congestion on the roads.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    But for so long, their use on the roads has gone unquestioned because they are seen as a necessary evil.  A little damage to the environment almost becomes justifiable when it is for as noble a cause as saving lives. However, recently, NHS has come up with a solution to prevent some of this damage.
                                </p>

                                <p class="thme-blockquote">
                                    The Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust looked for alternative ways to deliver packages that would be more environmentally friendly. The solution came in the form of electric bikes that would be used to deliver medical specimens, reports, and records across two hospital sites in Newcastle.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    The trial period of running electric bike cargo services in place of traditional diesel-run vehicles was smooth. The deliveries were made on time, and the delivery load volume was handled adequately.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    The electric bike delivery service ran on a trial period of three months. It replaced about 500 miles of transport that was previously conducted by diesel-based vehicles.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    The benefits of the electric bike cargo service were threefold. Firstly, it was estimated that carbon emissions were reduced in the environment by up to 436g in just three months. Secondly, almost £6,250 were saved in the trial period. And thirdly, it contributed to a better experience for both patients and staff as the delivery bikes took up less parking space.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    The trial period for electric bikes ran successfully, reducing carbon emissions and improving local air quality. However, there is a need to implement the electric delivery services in their full force throughout the NHS.
                                </p>

                                    Courier firms and retailers across the UK are temporarily suspending their services to the EU to give businesses time to understand and adjust to new border controls and import taxes.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    A major reason for this is that new procedural requirements at the border have been affecting turnaround time. There are now new customs paperwork requirements at the border, and courier service providers claim that they often have to return packages because senders fill out forms incorrectly or incompletely. Another reason for halting delivery services is the current delays and congestion at the UK ports.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    While some are hopeful that delivery services will restart all over soon, others are more sceptical of the situation. Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, said that he expected there would be a significant disruption at the UK borders due to Brexit customs requirements in the coming weeks. He expressed his concern that this disruption would be significantly greater than the slight disturbance observed so far. He said that the government had a responsibility to clarify what paperwork was required at the border.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    A lot of confusion regarding exports to the UK has stemmed from a clause of the new Brexit trade deal. Though the agreement assures overall tariff-free trade between the UK and the EU, there is a catch. According to the “rule of origin” clause, the goods manufactured outside of the UK/EU or those that predominantly contain components made outside of the UK/EU are subject to VAT and import duties when sold by UK businesses to the EU.
                                </p>

                                <p class="thme-blockquote">
                                    Many UK businesses that export to the EU have their supply chains outside of the UK and EU, usually in countries like China. This means they are now facing tariffs on their products. They have halted their exports to the EU as they are trying to figure out how they can switch to components made in the UK or the EU.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    This has meant that many food and clothing products that the UK used to export to the EU are no longer profitable for retailers. M&S has recently cut around 400 food products from its aisles in Northern Ireland. Debenhams and John Lewis have closed their international business. Fortnum & Mason has stopped shipments to Northern Ireland and the EU for the time being.

                                <p>
                                    Tariffs are also applicable to EU-manufactured products that pass through the UK to other EU countries without further manufacturing in the UK.

                                    The United States-based pharmaceutical company Pfizer recently announced that there would be a delay in the delivery of its coronavirus vaccines. The delay is said to be a result of changing the manufacturing process to increase the production of vaccines. Pfizer has decided to manufacture more vaccines in 2021 than it had planned earlier, which has resulted in a slight modification of its delivery schedules to the UK, Canada, and countries across the EU.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Several countries have protested or otherwise shown disapproval over the short notice given by Pfizer, saying it affects their vaccine distribution and administration programmes. Germany, who had placed the largest order for the Pfizer vaccine in the EU, expressed regret over the situation, calling the notice unexpected and short. The Lithuanian health minister also expressed the desire for the vaccine delivery schedule to be restored.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Finland, Denmark, Sweden, Lithuania, Estonia, and Latvia have written a letter to the EU, complaining about the fewer number of vaccines coming in and urging the EU to exert pressure over Pfizer-BioNTech. However, Pfizer has maintained that reduced delivery is a short-term issue only. Pfizer plans to increase the vaccine's shipments in late February and early March, making up for the reduced deliveries in January and early February and bringing the total number of vaccines delivered in the first quarter of the year equal to what was agreed beforehand.
                                </p>

                                <p class="thme-blockquote">
                                    The UK, which has already secured 40 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine, is also affected by the situation. The government and healthcare authorities are trying to understand the implications of the Pfizer vaccine's delay on their vaccine administration schedule. Still, they have positively maintained that they plan to meet their previous target of vaccinating all four priority groups by the mid of February.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    In large part, this is possible due to the availability of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine in the UK, which has been licensed and is being rolled out in the country. The EU, too, is not solely dependent on the Pfizer vaccine. The European Commission has made agreements with six pharmaceutical companies for purchasing their vaccines once they pass clinical trials. These are AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson, Sanofi-GSK, CureVac, Novavax, and Moderna. However, the fact remains that delays in the Pfizer vaccine delivery have made the EU lag behind the US and the UK in the immunization process.

                                    Artists and owners of art galleries know only too well the risks involved in shipping precious artwork through traditional or national mail and delivery services. Often, incredibly detailed and intricate works of art arrive at their intended destination broken or bent, causing disappointment to the buyer and an actual pain to the artist who put their heart, soul, and loads of time into making that singular piece.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    What’s worse is that the artist or the gallery owner receive no compensation for their loss, simply because these mainstream courier services do not provide any insurance.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    There are too many concerns when you need to make a delivery, ranging from how much will it cost to when will it reach the intended location to if it can be delivered to the exact spot you want. The last thing an art gallery owner wants is to worry about the artwork’s safety and security.
                                </p>

                                <p class="thme-blockquote">
                                    Artwork can often be fragile, made at odd angles, and in strange sizes. Art is truly based only on the artist’s inspiration, but when that artwork needs transporting, it comes down to the practicality, sane-headedness, and thoroughness of the couriers responsible for delivering it. Any slight on the part of the courier company can result in an immense loss for multiple parties.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Private courier companies provide professional services, making it their priority to deliver intact and unscratched packages. They even offer insurance covering any losses that may be incurred during delivery. However, that scenario does not even occur because they take multiple steps to safeguard the artwork.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    But what are these steps? These steps can include the use of crates, foams, and void packing.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Firstly, as artworks can be huge, they need crates that are made especially for them. These crates are sturdy and robust and may be of any thickness. They are appropriately lined with cushions or other materials and may also have wheels and handles.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    But creates alone are not enough. Before artwork can go into a container, cases have to be lined with foam that ensures the articles do not move at all. It serves as an added protection whose thickness is adjusted as required.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Void packing involves creating a cushion of air to protect the artwork before it goes in a crate. Vibration cannot pass through this space containing air, and this provides utmost protection to fragile items.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Through these steps, specialized courier services ensure that valuable pieces of art reach their destination safely.
                                </p>

                                    The coronavirus pandemic saw people losing jobs across industries all over the world. Small businesses had to shut down or let go of staff to cut down costs. Many jobs were lost due to the closing of public spaces like theaters, cinemas, clubs, and more.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    During such a time, there was one industry that thrived more than ever: the courier industry. The lockdown saw people restricted to their homes all across the country. At first, the situation was too distressing and alarming for people to shop online. But as people settled into the new way of living, e-sales went up all over, creating the demand for efficient delivery services.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    At the start of 2020, so great was this demand that popular couriers across the UK began struggling to meet customer needs. There was a brief period of confusion and mismanagement, where late deliveries, wrong deliveries, or damaged parcels became frequent.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    However, the UK couriers rose to the occasion, made their operations more efficient, and started hiring people. Thousands of opportunities became available in the courier industry by June 2020. These were immediately taken up by people who had lost jobs early on in the pandemic.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    This was just the first phase of the boom in the courier sector. Towards the end of the year 2020, courier services once again saw an unprecedented demand. With Christmas around the corner, people took to the internet to buy gifts for their loved ones. These then had to be delivered to homes across the country. Moreover, the UK was formally exiting the EU around that time, which had a significant effect on shipments and deliveries. Add to this the already high demand for everyday goods deliveries due to the pandemic, and more and more vacancies became available in the delivery sector.

                                    People struggling because of the pandemic were quick to avail of these opportunities; however, the situation was far from ideal. Usually, courier companies provide certain benefits to their employees, such as sick pays, delivery vehicles, and fuel costs. However, the new jobs created did not offer any of that.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    The new delivery drivers were mostly “self-employed,” meaning that they used their own vehicles and had to provide their own insurance. They were usually paid per delivery and got no sick pays, and had no job guarantee. Still, the new jobs were a way for them to make ends meet. By contracting these self-employed persons, courier companies found a low-cost way of meeting enhanced delivery needs during the pandemic.

                                    The demand for hot, delicious, and one-click-away food was never as high in history as it is now. With quick delivery options, more and more people are choosing to order food to their homes and workplaces instead of going out.

                                    Preference for online delivery options over visiting and shopping from brick-and-mortar shops is not limited to the food industry; it is a trend visible across all industries. According to statistics released by Eurostat, e-sales have been seeing a rise since 2009.

                                    Restaurant food delivery really became a hit due to third-party services that provide customers food on their doorsteps. These couriers leave no stone unturned in ensuring quality service, as restaurants are very particular about getting the best quality delivery service to ensure customer satisfaction.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Customers’ decisions are based around convenience, but that is not all. While they want food delivered to their homes quickly, they also expect a certain degree of quality for the additional delivery charges they pay. That is to say, food spillages, temperature inconsistencies, or appearance problems are not tolerated.
                                </p>

                                <p class="thme-blockquote">
                                    In fact, businesses can lose loyal customers quickly due to bad delivery experiences. Today, there are countless international food chains and local restaurants offering local and exotic cuisines. After even a single bad experience at any stage of ordering food, people write off restaurants forever. Sometimes, they even take to social media to rant about their negative experiences with a restaurant, severely impacting a restaurant’s sales. Thus, to retain customers and provide quality, restaurant owners work with top food couriers who guarantee timely and safe deliveries.

                                    Since customers prefer delivery and takeaway to dine-in, a new kind of restaurant has sprouted up. Established physical brands often introduce these ‘dark kitchens,’ which do not have any consumer sitting area. They cook food solely for delivery purposes. Since customers trust the brands who introduced these restaurants, they are quick to order food from them, which is then delivered through food couriers.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    From the success of the dark kitchens, it becomes apparent that the food delivery culture is here to stay and will keep on growing in the future. With the coronavirus outbreak in 2020, the food delivery sector, like all courier services, has seen a massive upsurge. It is likely that the food delivery sector will stay as strong as ever, even after the pandemic has subsided.

                                    With bars, clubs, and restaurants across the UK closing down, sales of alcoholic drinks went down in 2020. Overall, 2020 was a year when British drinkers bought less alcohol than they usually would. The WSTA (Wine and Spirit Trade Association) will release a report showing that beer sales fell by 10% and wine sales fell by 5%.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    The trade lost by hospitality venues has been picked up by supermarkets who enjoyed a surge in alcohol demand during the last year. From September to November, supermarkets saw a three-fold increase in alcohol sales compared with the same period in 2019.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    The increase in online orders of alcoholic beverages has not been enough to make up for the revenue lost by the hospitality sector, as overall sales of alcohol during the pandemic were lower than before it. It raised concerns that the surge in online drink orders might not be dispersed among customers throughout the country but could be driven by a specific segment of society whose drinking is motivated by stress and anxiety.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    The increase in online drink orders matches the overall trend of increased online orders in the UK. It is also in line with global trends, as there has been a 40% increase in online alcohol orders worldwide, amounting to $17bn in 2020 and projected to reach $40bn by 2024.
                                </p>

                                <p class="thme-blockquote">
                                    Concerned that some people might be having too much alcohol, supermarkets have addressed the problem of online orders by stopping delivery drivers from giving alcohol to people already drunk or minors.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    The International Alliance for Responsible Drinking (IARD) is coordinating this stricter control on online drink orders. Delivery services, large retailers, and some of the biggest drink brands have joined hands together to make this a reality.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Delivery drivers and staff who deliver drinks and food to the door are being trained to recognize signs of intoxication. If someone looks too young to be ordering alcohol, delivery people have to ID them. Just like pub owners can refuse alcohol to someone who has had too much, the delivery staff has to decide if someone is sober enough to receive the drink ordered.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Staff is also being taught to deescalate situations and prevent trouble if the customers get dissatisfied or angry at being reduced alcohol. Employers are also supposed to ensure that delivery drivers do not face disincentives like non-payments when they don’t make a delivery to someone they think is drunk.
                                </p>

                                    Have you ever wondered how the British army delivers its mail and packages? Well, the same way as everyone. They employ courier services for sending and receiving deliveries. However, unlike regular courier services, couriers in the British army have to undergo a rigorous training process before they can be recruited. The potential risks involved in the job and the sensitive nature of the documents being delivered necessitate such training.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    However, being a courier in the army has its perks, too. Aside from the pride that comes from serving the nation, couriers get to travel all over. They enjoy postings to different parts of the globe and get to see the army’s operations up-close. They also make £15,985 during their training and £20,400 as a private.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    An army courier has an important job. They enable soldiers to stay in touch with their family and friends and deliver Protectively Marked Material as required. They use state-of-the-art IT and satellite communication systems to run operations smoothly.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    To become a courier, an applicant must meet specific requirements, like falling between the 16 and 35-year age bracket, having a GCSE, and a certain body build and fitness level. If a person meets the initial requirements, they will be put into a training program that has several steps.
                                </p>

                                <p class="thme-blockquote">
                                    Even though a person is applying to be a courier, the initial training is that of a soldier, covering aspects like fieldcraft and handling rifles. The basic military course can be as long as 23 weeks or last only for 14 weeks, depending on whether you are a Junior Soldier or a Regular Soldier.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    The second step is a 15 weeklong Combat Logistician course. The course teaches general service driver modules, gives a broad knowledge of the operations and responsibilities of the Royal Logistic Corps, and lets the candidate practice driving. It culminates with the awarding of category C+E driver license.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Finally, there is a four-week course that teaches the trainee how to use the systems and software that the corps use to track mail. The trainee is also taught how to manage Top Secret materials.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    After 12 months on the job training and successful completion of training objectives, a candidate is awarded Class 2 status. This can be followed by upgrades to Class 1 and then Lance Corporal.

                                    The COVID-19 pandemic caused all kinds of shortages in the market, mainly due to the disruption of manufacturing and distribution channels. But shortages of lab equipment like sterile gloves and other basics may continue even after supply chains are restored. Scientists across the world have been having a difficult time securing lab supplies as the pandemic has caused a surge in demand for testing equipment.

                                <p>
                                    Shortages of gloves, centrifuge tubes, micropipettes, and other supplies have caused many projects to slow down or entirely stop, though researchers have been trying to find solutions and alternative ways. In the UK, the NHS spoke about supply issues with refrigerators, pipette tips, gloves, and other products. One surgical glove shortage was due to an increased demand incompatible with production and delays in sterilizing and packaging. In late 2020, the global demand for gloves exceeded supply by 200 billion. The situation was further exacerbated when the world’s largest producer of gloves, Top Glove, had to shut down some factories because of a corona outbreak among the workers.

                                    Some labs have also been reporting a shortage of lab animals. Pharmaceutical companies in the US have been struggling to find the rhesus monkeys. A surge in demand for the monkey for vaccine testing combined with a ban on importing wildlife from China caused the shortage, which then led to some lab projects coming to a stop.

                                    Scientists and researchers can have to wait for weeks for instruments to arrive, setting them way back of the schedule. Product shortages can mean researchers have to spend hours on end just planning their experiments to ensure the equipment is not used in vain. It has also caused weeks’ worth of delay for scientists working at important research centers.

                                    The breakdown in scientific supply chains can be observed all over the world. In Africa, the breaking down of supply chains has made nations see the danger in relying on foreign equipment. Africa is not alone in relying on foreign supply chains. The US imports most of its medical gloves from Malaysia. In September 2020, the US increased its gloves import by 17% as compared to the last year, but it was still not enough to meet the demand.

                                    The shortages have caused labs to adopt a reduce and reuse motto. Tubes and centrifuge tubes are being reused when circumstances allow, as well as gloves for non-sterile work. Labs are also cooperating with each other to exchange equipment as needed.

                                    If you’ve been around supply chain executives long enough, you must have noticed some terms pop up now and then. These may be “risk management,” “chain visibility,” or, as we are going to discuss today, “supply chain flexibility.”
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    In the modern market, technology is advancing at an unprecedented pace. The number of competitors in any particular field is also increasing at an alarming rate. The amount of innovation and productivity due to the increased competition has narrowed down and diversified consumer demand. It’s also why it has become more challenging to avoid short product lifecycles.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Any good supply chain system has a single motto: “to effectively track the consumer demand and respond by respectively modifying the supply chain and producing goods based on that demand.” This is also what defines supply chain flexibility.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Supply chain flexibility is considered much more important now than it was 50 years ago. Some factors that have made supply chain flexibility a priority for most organizations are:
                                </p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        <strong>Competitive Pricing </strong>
                                        <p>
                                            If two suppliers are essentially providing the same service with seemingly insignificant differences at different rates, the net consumer demand will ultimately benefit one of the suppliers. At the same time, the other will experience an accelerating decline in revenue.
                                        </p>

                                        <p>
                                            For this reason, actively managing your prices with respect to the market rates and popular demand has become crucial.
                                        </p>
                                    </li>

                                        <strong>Customer Experience </strong>
                                        <p>
                                            The term “customer experience” covers many characteristics, including the speed of delivery, product reliability and functionality, and an organization’s response to customer feedback.
                                        </p>

                                        <p>
                                            The standard for an “ideal customer experience” is evolving rapidly, and it’s essential to manage a supply chain, respectively.
                                        </p>
                                    </li>
                                    <br />

                                        <strong>Media Expectations </strong>
                                        <p>
                                            Ideological polarization is at its peak in many practical fields such as politics, ethics, and technology. This has a constant and determining effect on supply chain productivity and highlights the importance of flexibility to consumer expectations.
                                        </p>

                                        <p>
                                            For instance, when there is a decrease in demand, a rigid policy will likely result in a business shutdown because the organization will be unable to slow down its production, adjust raw-material purchases, or manage transport to experience the maximum profit.
                                        </p>

                                        <p>
                                            The downside of this is that when the demand resurfaces, the organization will miss a unique opportunity to achieve market dominance.
                                        </p>

                                        <p>
                                            A flexible supply chain aims to reduce just these kinds of adaptability shortcomings by adjusting its production and distribution operation to evolving and complex consumer demand patterns.
                                        </p>
                                    </li>

                                    The UK land bridge has for long been a traditional route for lorries coming from Ireland and headed to continental Europe. After crossing the Irish Sea, freight would be driven south through Wales and England to cross the channel between Dover and Calais. This route, though indirect, was fast and cheaper than other direct routes between Ireland and France.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    With Brexit, there are now border checks and customs formalities that can cause potential delays. Businesses in the EU are choosing to sidestep these customs requirements by staying within the single market and transporting freight by the longer but direct route between Ireland and France across the Irish Sea.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    While the UK government has claimed that trade volumes are returning to normal, freight trade across Ireland and Great Britain tells another story. In the third week of February, freight volumes from Ireland to GB on Stena Line ferries were down by 49% compared to last year. In contrast, freight volume going directly to France increased by 102%.

                                    Though the direct sea route between Ireland and France is more expensive and slower, more and more businesses in the bloc are opting to ship goods via this direct route. Stena already had a route between Rosslare and Cherbourg and has now started a new route between Dublin and Cherbourg. Compared to last year, the number of weekly crossings between Ireland and the continent via Stena routes has doubled.

                                <p>
                                    The Rosslare Europort's general manager says the new routes that have opened up between Ireland and the continent are booming. The number of weekly sailings from Ireland to Northern France has gone up three times, compared to last year. In January 2021, freight traffic from Rosslare to the European mainland saw an increase of 446%, compared to 2020.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Government agencies and port authorities have created over 160 new jobs in Rosslare, and local garages and cafes are seeing more business than before. Haulage companies in Ireland have also noticed this increase in freight export. One reason for direct trade within the EU market is that big companies prefer certainty and hassle-free operations.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    There are reports that many companies in Northern Ireland (which is still a part of the EU single market) are sending their freight to Ireland to be directly exported from Rosslare and Dublin. Many small businesses in the EU are choosing to have lorries travel back through the UK land bridge so that deliveries may be made to Britain on the way back to Ireland.

                                <p>
                                    While the first lockdown dealt a solid blow to both consumers and retailers, the third lockdown has seen smooth sailing of delivery operations right from picking up a product from the manufacturing industry to dropping it off at the customer’s home. This, in part, is due to the experience and foresight on the part of retailers and the delivery network.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    The UK’s delivery networks have proven to be a most resilient ecosystem – able to put up with near-constant pressure from various causes. The lockdowns caused episodes of panic buying where delivery slots at supermarkets became more coveted than the tickets to a famous singer’s concert. Moreover, the Brexit red tape caused a significant impact and led to considerable delays in shipping. Some areas in the UK saw limited delivery services as frontline workers in the delivery services were affected by the virus.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Despite everything, the delivery networks were able to adapt, innovate, and meet customers’ increased expectations. How did this come about? The secret lies in delivery networks laying the groundwork for their own recovery.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    There has been a trend, perhaps short-term, of focusing on and prioritizing the British customers over international ones. Many British retailers stopped their international operations to focus on the British market and provide exclusive services to customers within their own country.
                                </p>

                                <p class="thme-blockquote">
                                    Most of the local stores partnered with last-mile delivery companies, which allowed them to leverage their physical store to meet online orders placed locally through the ‘ship from store’ model. Brands were able to pick up stock from local stores and have it delivered to customers utilizing local distribution networks. This meant fast and efficient deliveries that utilized previously untapped stock and reduced pressure on the national distribution centres.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Moving forward, retailers will be best served by adopting a tech-first strategy that enables customers to be involved in every step of the delivery process by providing a truly connected CX. When customers choose delivery services, they consider a lot of factors, from hygiene to speed and ease, all of which delivery companies take not of and account for successfully. What can truly transform the delivery experience and keep the delivery network relevant even after the lockdowns and the pandemic is a modification of the delivery process to empower the customers to order, track, pay, and receive all on their own terms. High standards of delivery communications and personalized options throughout the delivery process can make customers loyal to a brand.

                                    Ever Given, the mega-vessel wedged in the Suez Canal is holding an estimated $9bn (£7bn) worth of goods a day and has caused more than 300 container ships to queue up. Most of these ships are carrying products made in the East and meant for Europe and Britain.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    The 400-metre Ever Given is as long as the height of the Empire State Building and has been stuck in the canal since Tuesday, the 23rd of March 2021. The ship is among the largest cargo ships in the world and is carrying 20,000 containers. It is operated by Evergreen Marine, a Taiwanese company. Currently, the Suez Canal Authority is trying its best to dislodge the vessel.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    About 30% of the world’s shipping containers pass along the Suez Canal, and with the passage currently blocked, goods will reach their destination later than normal, whether ships choose to wait for Ever Given to be dislodged or decide to go the longer route around the Cape of Good Hope.
                                </p>

                                <p class="thme-blockquote">
                                    When the ship is dislodged, and the passage for container ships is resumed, there will be a large influx of ships through the canal. Many of these ships will make their way to Felixstowe, Southampton, and Liverpool in the UK. But due to limited dock space in these locations, unloading goods from these ships can take quite some time. There could be some noticeable shortages in the UK, depending on how long the canal disruption lasts.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    There have been claims that a toilet paper crisis may occur in the coming days if the blockage lasts long enough. If this were to happen, it would come after just one year of supermarkets being short of toilet rolls after frenzy buying before the UK’s first national lockdown.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Since container freight gets most goods to most shops, blockage of containers can impact a whole range of imported goods that people are used to seeing at shops. Producers in the UK who rely on just-in-time supply chains will also see some problems if small parts are not available when needed. If the blockage lasts long enough, it could affect just about anything available at stores. Since oil tankers have also been stuck waiting on either side of the canal, oil prices have gone up and shipping rates for fuel tankers have also increased.
                                </p>

                                    When shopping at physical stores, people return about 10% of the goods they buy. This figure is significantly higher for online purchases. According to an estimate, buyers returned one-fourth of all fashion goods they purchased online in 2019.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    The pandemic saw three times increase in online sales in the year 2020. But many of these items were then returned to retailers. As per a study, 38% of online shoppers in the UK said that the pandemic made them more confident in returning items bought online. The young online shoppers were buying goods and then returning them before the first lockdown, but the older generation also acquired this habit during the pandemic. 60% of the buyers who returned something bought online in the last year were aged 16 to 34.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Clothes are a common item that shoppers return since they cannot try them on before buying to see how they fit. And since most people are stuck between two sizes, they often order more than they need and then just return the excess. Another factor driving the high rate of returned goods is that buyers usually do not have to pay for the return of their packages and are not penalized in any way.
                                </p>

                                <p class="thme-blockquote">
                                    With buyers more likely to return online goods, retailers are faced with a few problems. Firstly, they have to pay for the return, and often also the delivery charges of the delivered goods out of their pocket. In addition to this expenditure, retailers also have to figure out a way to get the goods back into their supply chains. Some customers do not return items for weeks or months on end, and when those items make it back to the retailers, their resale value can have decreased so much that they generate no profit.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    There is also the concern of the carbon footprint left by making unnecessary deliveries and then returning those items. Also, to get a competitive edge in the market, most companies offer same-day deliveries. Customers may be inclined to think over their purchases and make responsible choices if they are shown the carbon footprint of same-day delivery versus a longer delivery and then given the option to choose between the two. As online shopping becomes part of everyday life, it is hoped that buyers return lesser goods than they currently do.

                                    Covid-19 hit the UK hard in 2020. There are as of yet no chances of it subsiding in 2021 as new strains of the coronavirus have already made their way into the country. Prime Minister Boris Johnson released a stay at home order just at the start of the year, two days before the confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK touched 60,000 for the first time.

                                    Now, with the country on its third national lockdown, the stream of online shopping is surely going to pour in more than ever. When the UK went under its first lockdown in March 2020, courier services were put under a lot of strain to cope with the sudden surge in online sales. According to a survey conducted by Citizens Advice, 47% of the Britishers faced one or more parcel delivery issues. Not only that but almost one-fifth of these people also suffered some financial loss at the hands of courier services.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Looking at the statistics, the question now is: Are courier services and the logistics sector ready to deal with the rightfully predicted increase in delivery demand this time around?
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    A home delivery specialist at Parcel Hero has claimed that this newly ensued national lockdown has caused no severe delays in deliveries. When the lockdown was announced, online shopping websites crashed because everyone rushed in to buy the essentials needed to survive another stay-in period. This came around the time of the new Brexit red tape that is already posing many challenges to the traders with its new trade border and increased delivery costs, customs data requirements, checks on parcels, and overall, more complicated processes.
                                </p>

                                <p class="thme-blockquote">
                                    However, it seems that courier services are coping well with the changes this time. They had been planning for months to avoid the delays faced by the public in the previous lockdowns. Even though there are still some issues with the functionality of online supermarket websites – considering everyone is panicked and out to buy everything online at once – it will all be resolved soon as e-commerce retailers have already hired more staff and warehouse operatives to meet the increased demand.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    However, we are yet to see whether courier services can keep up the good work in the coming days or will they fall under the delivery stresses of Brexit red tape and lockdown.

Logging thousands of miles, drivers have delivered critical medical supplies and everyday goods to homes across the nation. The latest deliveries being made are the coronavirus vaccines. However, truck drivers delivering vaccines have, in many cases, not being vaccinated themselves.

                                <p>
                                    As the vaccine rollout is gaining momentum in the US, logistics operators and transport groups argue that their workers should have better access to vaccines. This pushes parcel carriers, truck drivers, and dockworkers into the debate over who should get shots on a priority basis – a debate that already involves public-transit workers, teachers, and people in the food, utilities, and aviation industries.

                                    That the coronavirus can impact the front lines of distribution became evident in Southern California when a surge in covid-19 cases caused a reduction in the cargo-handling crews at Long Beach and Los Angeles ports. The result was a slowdown at the gateways and overcrowding in the US supply chains. More than a third of all containers coming into the US arrive at Southern California ports, and the slowing down of operations at these ports prompted the start of vaccinations of dockworkers.

                                    However, other logistics operators across the US have not been as lucky. Though the federal recommendations for prioritizing vaccinations consider transport workers essential, many local jurisdictions have not made logistics workers eligible for vaccines yet. In Michigan, for example, freight workers can only get the vaccine if they are 65 or older.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Another barrier faced by truck drivers in being vaccinated is that they are frequently on the road and often spend weeks delivering goods across states. Vaccinations are distributed to states based on their population, and local jurisdictions are primarily responsible for administering shots to people. However, truck drivers cannot easily be present to get a shot at a specific time or place. Even if they get one shot in their home state, they cannot abandon work to come back and get the second shot three weeks later.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    The American Trucking Association is calling for prioritizing vaccine access for truck drivers, while NATSO is asking for setting up vaccination centres at truck stops, where medical clinics already exist. Since truck drivers are usually outside their home state, doing so would make it possible for them to get vaccinated.

                                    A study published in the Centre for Economic Performance in 2019 found that Brexit had affected UK firms’ outward investments. After the Brexit vote, there was a 12% increase in UK firms’ investments in the EU countries. This increased investment in the EU countries by UK firms totalled £8.3 billion. Further, the study found no evidence of a ‘Global Britain’ effect, mainly because UK firms’ investments could not be traced to OECD countries outside the EU.

                                <p>
                                    This increased investment in the EU countries represented a loss in investment for the UK. Moreover, it reflected that UK firms were offshoring their production to the EU in anticipation of barriers to trade and migration after Brexit, which could make the UK a less attractive place for business.
                                </p>

                                    The UK officially exited the EU on 1 January 2021, and before a whole month has passed, Dutch warehouses and logistics companies are seeing a boom in investments from UK-based firms. The Netherlands is experiencing a boom in investments and jobs as British businesses are looking to rent warehouse space.

                                <p>
                                    With Brexit, thousands of small businesses face operational challenges as exports to the EU are severely impacted because of delays at ports, the increased cost of shipping, and the addition of VATS and customs duties. To avoid delays and increased costs, small businesses throughout the UK are looking to invest in distribution networks inside the EU. The move is not meant only to improve business efficiency; in some cases, it is the only way these small businesses can continue running.
                                </p>

                                <p class="thme-blockquote">
                                    When UK firms deliver to the EU from within the EU itself, their customers no longer have to pay customs duties, VAT charges, or put up with delays at ports. Netherlands is an attractive option for companies looking to establish themselves in the EU, partly because it has the biggest port in Europe.
                                </p>

                                    According to the Netherlands Foreign Investment Agency, the number of British companies looking for a base in the Netherlands has doubled in a year and a half. Dutch logistics companies are flooded with calls for help, as businesses are looking to set up distribution networks in the country.

                                    While half of the companies investing in the Netherlands are from the UK, the rest are from Asia and the US. These Asian and US-based companies want a foothold in Europe but decided against setting up a base in the UK because it has departed from the EU.

                                    The lockdown in the UK has impacted every aspect of people's lives. Among them, a critical hindrance citizens face is when returning goods bought online. It is estimated that UK citizens have £2.4 billion worth of unreturned goods at home simply because lockdown restrictions make it difficult and risky to head out of homes to return packages.

                                <p>
                                    InPost, a locker network, conducted research to find that more than half (57%) of online shoppers find returning goods a tedious and time-taking business during the coronavirus lockdown, and a significant percentage of them (45%) would like retailers to make the process of returning bought items simpler.

                                <p>
                                    Half of the people with goods yet to be returned (51%) said they accumulated more items to return in January than they would have in normal conditions.

                                <p>
                                    Data collected by Opinium found that people who have unwanted items, on average, have three items per person, amounting to about £165.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Online shoppers said that returning goods pose a threat as they do not want to be in close proximity with other people. 54% of people cited concerns of coming into contact with others at parcel drop-off shops, Post Offices, or in stores when returning bought goods. 62% of people said that they would prefer it if retailers provided the option of a contact-free return.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    65% of people also said they did not want to spend their time waiting in queues at parcel drop-off points or Post Offices. Another 42% of people said that if there were a parcel dropoff point near their home, they would be encouraged to return parcels quickly.
                                </p>

                                <p class="thme-blockquote">
                                    Businesses and retailers can benefit when people make returns early as about half (46%) people said that they are more cautious about making purchases when they are waiting for their refunds to arrive. Quicker returns and refunds would therefore help both people's pockets and the economy.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Shoppers in the survey also want retailers to offer longer returns windows as well as clearer return policies. More than one-fourth of the people (29%) said that retailers should also issue refunds more quickly during the pandemic. Respondents also believe that when making purchases, they are now more likely to check the timeframe in which items can be returned and what options retailers provide for returning products bought online. This shows that returns are a potentially valuable opportunity for retailers to show goodwill to customers, especially during lockdown restrictions.

                                    Factories in America are seeing an unexpected surge in business that has owners scrambling to assemble critical supplies required for manufacturing goods. There is an increased demand for appliances, furniture, and other goods that has many industries in a frenzy.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    As factory owners attempt to speed up their business operations, they have encountered a problem: the country’s supply chains are stretched tight, and the process to obtain supplies has become long and bothersome.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    The economy, which had suffered badly due to COVID-19 in 2020, is now snapping back; companies are hiring workers to get more work done. But supplies that previously came in one or two days are taking up to three weeks to make it to the factory. Some items cannot be delivered for months on end.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Factory owners are feeling frustrated because, on the one hand, they have increased demand and have hired workers to increase their output, and on the other hand, they aren’t able to manufacture and ship as many products as they would have liked because of shortages in supply.
                                </p>

                                <p class="thme-blockquote">
                                    For the most part, the boom in supply is coming from houses that were able to do well during the pandemic. In January, consumer spending on goods rose by 6%, even when spending on services went down by 1%.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Customers are impatient, asking companies to work overtime and do whatever they can to make deliveries possible. Prices are going up as even basic supplies like wooden pallets are becoming hard to come by. Many companies are taking twice the usual amount of time to deliver products.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Despite difficulties in procuring supplies, the manufacturing sector is booming, even while others are struggling. According to a report, US manufacturing activity in February was expanding at the fastest pace in three years.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    However, delays in the delivery of supplies are found throughout the manufacturing industry. Backlogs are growing as stockpiles shrink.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    One reason for the shortage of parts is a shortage of labor previously responsible for manufacturing those parts. These shortages may last till fall when people are vaccinated and feel safe in joining work.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Even the White House is concerned by the breakdown in supply chains. President Biden issued an order to shock-proof supplies of vital components like computer chips. An official at the National Security Council said that they would attempt to prevent supply chain problems in the future.

                                    Last year saw the death of 14 delivery drivers in South Korea. While their deaths cannot be directly linked with overwork, their families describe the cause of death as ‘kwarosa – a Korean term that means death by a stroke or heart attack due to backbreaking work.
                                </p>

                                    In South Korea, deliveries are expected to be made within hours, not days. With the surge in online shopping during the pandemic, the volume of online orders has become overwhelming. The riders have to work long shifts to satisfy customers.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    The increase in online orders, and subsequent pressure on delivery drivers, has been observed around the developed world. In South Korea, online shopping was already a growing trend, with demand for delivered goods increasing by 10% every year. By 2020, it increased by double that.
                                </p>

                                    This mounting pressure on delivery riders is a cause of their deaths, claims the union. Kim was a 36-year old delivery driver who messaged his colleague he couldn’t take work anymore, after 21 hours of working in a shift where he delivered 400 packages. Four days later, he died.
                                </p>

                                    Jang Deok-jin was a 27-year old delivery driver and a Taekwondo enthusiast. According to his family, he lost 33 lbs on the job in 18 months. One night, he came from work at 6 am and went for a shower. His father found him dead in the bathtub an hour later. Mr. Jang went to the South Korean National Assembly and asked congress members to look at the strenuous conditions that led to his son’s death.

                                <p>
                                    President Moon Jae-in took notice of drivers’ deaths and asked for a change in delivery employees’ working conditions. South Korea’s labour ministry also stepped in, asking the large logistics companies to sign a declaration guaranteeing drivers would get enough rest and would not be overworked.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    The biggest logistics companies made public apologies over the drivers’ deaths. They committed to hiring more drivers and ensuring their employees had reasonable workloads. There is, however, a concern that since many drivers don’t sign contracts directly with the company but with intermediaries who are independent agents, they can be left outside the protection of labour law.
                                </p>

                                    The publicity to delivery drivers’ harsh and strenuous working conditions has affected South Korean shoppers. While some windows displayed notes like ‘’Dear deliveryman, it’s okay to be late,” other people have been presenting drivers with hot coffee and breakfast. Social media hashtags in support of the drivers have also been trending.

                                <p>
                                    Ever since the UK’s departure from the European bloc, supply chains and distribution networks have been affected across almost every industry. The food industry is no different.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    The Food and Drink Federation has cautioned that food supply chain costs can go up as a result of Brexit and that these additional costs would be passed on to retailers or customers. The manufacturers can also have to bear increased costs. Even with added costs for everyone, there are still chances that supermarkets in Northern Ireland will face shortages.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    According to the Federation, the EU-UK supply chains need re-engineering in light of the Brexit deal, which will come with short-term and long-term costs. Over the next months, the way manufacturers in the UK and the EU interact is also likely to change. The current costs associated with the supply chains are due to increased paperwork, border disruptions, and non-tariff barriers.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Businesses exporting from the UK to the EU face regulations that were rolled out at the end of 2020, not giving suppliers in the food and beverage industry enough time to get ready to meet them. As a result, companies that previously completed paperwork in hours are now taking days to get it done.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    The cherry on the top is the rule of origin clause of the Brexit deal, according to which products made outside of the UK are subject to tariff charges when exported to the EU. This clause means that businesses have to start record-keeping and take care of the rule of origin calculations, something they have not done before. For companies in the food industry, which run on tight margins and have just-in-time supply chains, this can mean a substantial delay in deliveries.
                                </p>

                                <p class="thme-blockquote">
                                    The greatest foreseeable concern is in Northern Ireland. Supermarkets can face significant disruptions in moving products from the UK to Northern Ireland around April when the three-month grace period that exempts animal-origin products from full certification comes to an end.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Some hope to see a workable solution for retailers to avoid this disruption. While a spokesperson for the Cabinet Office has said they plan to work with the food industry, supermarkets, and the Northern Ireland Executive to streamline transport of goods, the Cabinet Office maintains that businesses need to be compliant with the new regulations to avoid disruptions.

                                    The UK is currently in its third national lockdown. With millions of people confined to their homes, transport and logistics firms have a lot to contend with as people are opting for home deliveries once again. As customers are now accustomed to speaking with businesses online or over the phone, it has become essential for delivery companies to invest in customer communication. This is an excellent way of displaying transparency, enhancing relationships, and establishing themselves as a leading force in the industry.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    As technology has advanced, so have customer expectations risen. People are now used to getting quick responses and support from companies regarding their orders, product queries, or general questions. While this has helped reduce barriers between customers and businesses and promoted transparency, it has added to a company's responsibilities. Customers want detailed information regarding their order, such as exact delivery time, tracking the location, and delivery driver information.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    During the pandemic, a significant number of businesses have stated that they provide more order updates now than before. And though online shopping and home deliveries have substantially increased during the pandemic, many logistics firms also report an overall decline in their business operations. This means that businesses have to provide top-notch service and complete transparency to customers to ensure they become repeat buyers. In that regard, effective communication tops the list.
                                </p>

                                <p class="thme-blockquote">
                                    There are three key considerations in maintaining effective communication with customers. The first one is to be proactive. That means taking the lead and providing essential information to the customer about their order before they ask for it. No customer will complain about receiving an order update, but they will likely complain about not being notified of their order's delivery status. Taking this proactive approach in all areas of customer communication will lead to greater customer satisfaction and improve confidence and trust in your brand.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Enhanced messaging can be used to find out how customers view your business. You can collect valuable feedback through a simple SMS survey and then work on problem areas based on the answers. The input should be used to personalize future updates between customers and your business.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    You may also use personalized messages to develop a long-lasting relationship with your customer. While drafting individual messages can take time, it can add to customer loyalty and engagement significantly. Through implementing these three techniques, businesses and logistics firms can retain more customers successfully.

                                    During the pandemic, there has been a significant surge in online orders that is expected to carry on even after the restoration of normalcy in people’s lives. The surge in e-commerce originally stretched supply chains thin and put a lot of pressure on businesses to make deliveries on time. With time, supply chain efficiency was restored. However, businesses are now competing to retain customers by providing faster deliveries at lowered costs. One way that retailers can attract more business is through micro-fulfilment.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Micro-fulfilment is a business model that focuses on setting up centres within urban localities close to the end consumer. Using a mix of automation and manual labour, micro-fulfilment centres (MFCs) allow retailers to operate on a click and collect business model. MFCs average about 5,000 to 10,000 square feet of space, meaning they can be built at the back of existing stores or maybe built as standalone structures in the city centre. Since MFCs are automated fulfilment centres, they can provide online item pickup in quick turnaround times, sometimes within an hour. Usually, MFCs can pick 70-80% of the order, while manual picking is required for the remaining part of the order.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    MFCs transfer the last-mile delivery costs to customers, as they have to drive to the store and pick up the item they purchased online. As these centres are located with urban localities, customers can pick items on their daily commute.
                                </p>

                                <p class="thme-blockquote">
                                    Through automation, MFCs help reduce the operational costs associated with manual labour, which a business can then use as leverage point by providing discounted prices to customers. The greater efficiency and shorter turnaround times can also be a considerable advantage in times of spikes in demand. Using predictive technology, MFCs can be stocked with products that are in-demand and thus earn greater profits when there are unusual spikes in consumer demand.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    General merchandise, grocery, convenience stores, drugstores, and department stores are all retail categories that can benefit from MFCs. Many big brands in the retail industry have already started installing MFCs at the back of their existing stores. Some have even gone ‘dark,’ meaning that their stores do not serve walk-in customers anymore. Even though MFCs come with substantial upfront costs, in the long run, they can help reduce costs and increase speed, enhancing customer experience.

                                    Before Brexit, Northern Ireland and Ireland had a practically invisible border, with no border checks and no cameras. People and goods moved between the two countries easily when both were part of the UK. With Brexit talks, a significant concern was the border between these two. It was decided that to avoid checks between Ireland and Northern Ireland, Northern Ireland would continue following many of the EU’s rules as the rest of the UK (GB) exited the union.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    The EU requires checks on the goods entering it, so the UK and the EU agreed to set up a regulatory border between Great Britain and Northern Ireland where goods from GB could be inspected before passing through.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    With these rules and regulations becoming effective on 1 January, the Dublin port in Ireland has become a major bottleneck for businesses. 20% of Northern Ireland’s trade takes place through Dublin, which is experiencing delays in getting customs clearance for goods that are coming through Great Britain. Freight companies in Ireland are also reporting difficulties.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    The Irish customs authorities are putting part of the blame for these difficulties on businesses being unprepared for new changes. The Irish Revenue Commissioner expressed surprise over some companies failing to address the work that should have been completed in the years leading up to 1 January. They also added that, though they recognized the challenges faced by some businesses, as part of the European Union, they had some responsibilities towards the bloc and had to ensure that they did not put the free movement of Irish goods within the EU at risk.
                                </p>

                                <p class="thme-blockquote">
                                    Some haulage firms have expressed the opinion that the Irish and the UK customs systems are unable to integrate, making the whole process complicated and increasing the risks for errors. Trucks arriving from GB have to wait in their vehicles for hours, with their Northern Ireland operators incurring costs per hour.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    The Freight Transport Association Ireland wrote to the Irish Prime Minister, intimating that lorries are getting stranded at Dublin Port or stuck in UK depots because of the new customs and food safety formalities. A shortage of customs agents who can correctly process declarations has created a backlog of goods including food supplies, car parts, and furniture. However, the Irish Revenue Commissioners responded that businesses had been intimated last year on what preparations were required of them and that there is no legal option of phasing out the implementation of the formalities.
